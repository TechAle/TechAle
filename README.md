## My Computer science's path
I Started with a simple game-developing with pygame on the 2017-2018, unfortunately i lost a lot of my old's files.
One year passed and, because of school, i started learning c/c++/c#/js but, meawhile, i started selenium and data-science.
The next year, i started with machine learning, so a deep study into math and, because of school again, also php+java+mysql
