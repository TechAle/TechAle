<h1 align='center'> Hi, I'm Ale  ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2> Who am i? </h2>
<p>I'm currently an high school student of a computer science's school<br>
   I really like coding and exploring new subjects</p>
 <hr>
<h2> Which subjects did i explored? </h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      I Started with a simple game-developing with pygame on the 2017-2018, unforunatly i lost a lot of my old's files.<br>Sometimes
      i still use pygame for example <a href="https://github.com/TechAle/snake-DNN">my DNN of snake</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Then, because of school, i learned some basics of c/c++/c#/js (till pointer, function, class) but then, after this, i learned
      multi-threading (with all the problems correlated). A good example of everything can be found on the project 
      <a href="https://github.com/TechAle/Progetto-Ospedale-4bin">Novara-Hospital</a>
      (a project that all my teachers gave to my group that comprends everything) 
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, i learned some stuff about selenium; i created a 
      <a href="https://github.com/TechAle/TumblrBot">cool bot</a> that can fully manage a tumblr's account</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Then i started studying something about data-analyst (numpy, pandas, basic keras), an example of project is an analystic of
  a <a href="https://github.com/TechAle/salc1-data-mining">server</a> and so, of course, a study more in deep of math (an example,
  <a href="https://github.com/TechAle/PongAi">my bot</a> that can play perfectly the game "pong"
   </li>
   <li>
    Then, for school, i started studying the model "socket", php and mysql<br>
    Meanwhile, for myself,  machine learning (an example, <a href="https://github.com/TechAle/snake-DNN">my DNN of snake</a>) and
    a little bit of git and game developing
  </li>
  </ol>
